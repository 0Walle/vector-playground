# Vector Playground

The vector playground is a interactive tool for play with vectors in a plane. It can be used to learn vector operations or to show how they work geometrically.

## How to use

In the left area there is the definitions area, write math expressions to show them on the graph.

### Vectors

Vectors are written with the syntax `(x, y)` with x and y being numbers.

Vector operations are addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, scalar division and dot product (`*` operator).

The absolute operator `|v|` returns the magnitude of a vector or absolute of a number.

### Trigonometric functions

Avaible trigonometric functions are `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `arcsin`, `arccos`, `arctan`.
